    "\n",
    "KAPE operates using:\n",
    "- **Targets** — identify which artifacts to collect  \n",
    "- **Modules** — process or parse those artifacts using external tools  \n",

    "\n",
    "During live response, the examiner must be careful not to alter system state more than necessary. The following best practices apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use trusted external storage** for running tools and saving data.  \n",
    "2. **Collect volatile data first** (RAM, running processes, network connections, clipboard, etc.).  \n",
    "3. **Document system time and state** before collection begins.  \n",
    "4. **Capture system artifacts using pre-configured KAPE targets** to ensure consistency.  \n",
    "5. **Hash collected data immediately** after acquisition.  \n",
    "6. **Record every action in a chain of custody log.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These practices support evidentiary integrity and admissibility."
